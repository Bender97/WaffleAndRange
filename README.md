## Installation

Setup the environment and clone this repo:
```
pip install pyaml==6.0 tqdm=4.63.0 scipy==1.8.0 torch==1.11.0 tensorboard=2.8.0
pip3 install pycuda pycu
git clone https://github.com/Bender97/WaffleAndRange
pip install -e ./
```

Then, compile the cuda related stuff.
```
cd cudastuff
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j5
```


Download the trained models:
```
wget https://github.com/valeoai/WaffleIron/files/10294733/info_datasets.tar.gz
tar -xvzf info_datasets.tar.gz
```
[**SemanticKITTI model**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bSiQIvdA9P08NJS05qNXpcsAd6l_sIDw/view?usp=sharing)



## Testing pretrained models

To evaluate the SemanticKITTI trained model, type
```
python launch_train.py \
--dataset semantic_kitti \
--path_dataset /path/to/kitti/ \
--log_path ./pretrained_models/WaffleAndRange-256__kitti/ \
--config ./configs/WaffleIron-48-256__kitti.yaml \
--fp16 \
--restart \
--eval
```
This should give you a validation mIoU of 69.0 %.

**Remark:** *On SemanticKITTI, the code above will extract object instances on the train set (despite this being not necessary for validation) because this augmentation is activated for training on this dataset (and this code re-use the training script). This can be bypassed by editing the `yaml` config file and changing the entry `instance_cutmix` to `False`. The instances are saved automatically in `/tmp/semantic_kitti_instances/`.*
